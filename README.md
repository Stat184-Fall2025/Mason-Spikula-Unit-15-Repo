# Mason-Spikula-Unit-15-Repo

This project is to make sure that I am familiar with how GitHub works.

The data comes from palmers penguins, babynames, and armed forces data.

The current plan is to:

- Create a dev branch and make multiple commits
- Create issues and close them
- Create pull requests and merge branches
- make a readme

How the Repo Is Organized

main branch: Contains the final version of the project.
dev branch: Used for development and testing changes before merging into main.
README.md: Explains the project.
